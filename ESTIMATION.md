# Alicart Development Estimation (Revised)

## Overview
This document provides a revised estimation for the Alicart project, considering that we're working with an existing CMS infrastructure. The focus is on Alicart-specific customizations and frontend adjustments.

*Note: 1 Story Point â‰ˆ 1 day of development work for a senior developer*

## Feature Breakdown & Estimates

### 1. Frontend Customization (8 SP, ~8 days)
- Homepage redesign and customization (3 SP)
- Category pages adaptation (2 SP)
- Resource pages adaptation (2 SP)
- Mobile responsiveness and UI/UX improvements (1 SP)

### 2. LTO System Customization (6 SP, ~6 days)
- LTO management adjustments (2 SP)
- LTO display and presentation (2 SP)
- Menu activation system (2 SP)

### 3. Content Management Adjustments (4 SP, ~4 days)
- Category structure modifications (1 SP)
- Resource management customization (2 SP)
- "Feel Special" section implementation (1 SP)

### 4. Integration & Testing (4 SP, ~4 days)
- System integration testing (2 SP)
- User acceptance testing (1 SP)
- Performance optimization (1 SP)

## Total Estimation
- Total Story Points: 22 SP
- Estimated Development Time: ~22 days
- Recommended Buffer (20%): 4 days
- Total Project Timeline: ~26 days (approximately 5 weeks)

## Additional Considerations
1. **Testing & QA**: Add 15% of development time for testing
2. **Documentation**: Add 5% of development time for documentation
3. **Deployment**: Add 5% of development time for setup
4. **Project Management**: Add 10% of development time for management

## Final Timeline
- Development: 26 days
- Testing & QA: 4 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- Deployment: 1 day
- Project Management: 3 days
- **Total Project Duration**: ~35 days (approximately 7 weeks)

## Assumptions
1. Existing CMS infrastructure is stable and well-documented
2. No major backend changes required
3. Design assets and requirements are clear
4. Regular client feedback and availability
5. Minimal third-party integrations needed

## Risk Factors
1. Design approval timeline
2. Content migration if needed
3. Client feedback and change requests
4. Browser compatibility requirements
5. Performance optimization needs

*Note: These estimates are based on the assumption that we're primarily working with frontend customizations and minor backend adjustments to the existing CMS.*
