## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Backend:
- All controllers now have `reorder()` method
- Validates incoming order data
- Updates priority in database
- Returns JSON response

### Frontend:
- Uses SortableJS library via CDN
- Drag handles on first column
- Visual feedback during drag (bg-info, bg-light classes)
- AJAX call to update order on drop
- Success alert message (auto-dismiss after 3 seconds)
- Error handling in console

### Routes Added:
```php
Route::post('ltos/reorder', [LtoController::class, 'reorder']);
Route::post('lto_months/reorder', [LtoMonthController::class, 'reorder']);
Route::post('ltos/files/reorder', [LtoFileController::class, 'reorder']);
```

## 🎯 How It Works
1. User drags row by grip icon (⋮⋮)
2. Drop to reorder
3. JavaScript collects new order from all rows
4. Sends AJAX POST to `/reorder` endpoint
5. Backend updates priorities in database
6. Success message appears briefly
7. Order persists in database

## 🔧 Key Changes

1. `app/Http/Controllers/LtoController.php` - Added reorder method
2. `app/Http/Controllers/LtoMonthController.php` - Added reorder method
3. `app/Http/Controllers/LtoFileController.php` - Added reorder method, updated index
4. `routes/web.php` - Added 3 new reorder routes

7. `resources/views/backend/ltos/files/index.blade.php` - Added drag-and-drop
8. `resources/views/layouts/sidebar.blade.php` - Updated menu text

### Database:

- `lto_months` table has `priority` column
- `lto_files` table has `priority` column
